    - Board dimensions: 3x3, 4x4, 99x101, etc. (user provides) DONE
    - Winning condition has variable number of characters: 3, 4, 5, etc. (user provides) DONE
    - Game messages should have configurable target: console (System.out) or logs (for the sake of this exercise it’s OK to make it System.err), or external printer. DONE
    - before game starts it asks who goes first, O or X DONE
    - We are bi-lingual: Polish and English are fine. In future we want to add more languages: messages are to be read from a file for chosen language. Choosing the language depends on configuration variable. DONE
